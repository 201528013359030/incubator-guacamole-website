If you need (or wish to provide) help with Guacamole, there are [forums](https://sourceforge.net/p/guacamole/discussion/) on the [SourceForge project page](http://sourceforge.net/projects/guacamole/). You will need to register a username with SourceForge to use the forums. There is also an IRC channel on freenode.net dedicated to Guacamole support: #guacamole-help.

The central body of documentation is the [Guacamole manual](/doc/gug/). It is kept up-to-date with each release, and provides a massive amount of information in one place. The manual contains installation and configuration instructions, as well as instructions for using the application itself. There is also a large section devoted entirely to development tutorials and descriptions of the architecture and APIs of the Guacamole core.

The Guacamole team monitors the IRC channels and SourceForge forums daily and responds whenever time permits.

Reporting Problems
-----------------------------

If you think you've encountered a bug in Guacamole or any of its components, or you wish to request a feature, please create a new issue in [JIRA](https://glyptodon.org/jira/). This JIRA instance is hosted by [Glyptodon LLC](http://glyptodon.org/), which is the open source company formed by the Guacamole team.

New issues enter the backlog and are prioritized along with all other reported issues, whether those issues were reported internally or by members of the wider open source community. Depending on the issue, work may not begin until higher-priority issues are taken care of, so please be patient. If you absolutely need something fixed or implemented immediately, and it is not otherwise an upstream priority, you are welcome to [contribute to the Guacamole project](/open-source#contribute), or to fund the change through Glyptodon LLC. This is one of the major benefits of Guacamole being open source.

Commercial Support
------------------------------

One of the main target audiences for Guacamole are enterprises and companies that need to provide access to many computers, hence Guacamole's design as a gateway. If you are a commercial company, and want dedicated support, there are two main options available: leveraging the community, which provides support when time is available purely for the sake of the greater good, and [Glyptodon LLC](http://glyptodon.org/), which is the company founded as a result of Guacamole's growth.

Both the Guacamole team and the rest of the open source community tend to be very responsive to questions from others, regardless of whether those questions are from commercial companies.

Support provided to commercial companies, particularly support which results in implementation of new features, is one of the main driving forces behind Guacamole's development. It leads to new and useful features being prioritized and brought to the community, and helps keep Guacamole development active and focused.
