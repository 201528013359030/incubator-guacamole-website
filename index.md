What is Guacamole?
------------------------------

Guacamole is a **clientless remote desktop gateway**. It supports standard protocols like VNC and RDP.

We call it _clientless_ because no plugins or client software are required.

Thanks to HTML5, once Guacamole is installed on a server, all you need to access your desktops is a web browser.

...and it's free?
---------------------

Yes!

Guacamole is and will always be **free and open source software**. It is licensed under the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

We feel this sets us apart from other remote desktop solutions, and gives us a [distinct advantage](/open-source).

What about support?
------------------------------

As an open source project, free support is always available to anyone through our [forums on SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/p/guacamole/discussion/) and through the #guacamole-help and #guacamole-dev IRC channels on [freenode](http://freenode.net/).

We maintain thorough documentation for Guacamole and its components in an [online manual](/doc/gug/), as well as full [API documentation](/api-documentation) for the Guacamole core. Like the software itself, these resources will always be free.

For enterprises, dedicated commercial support is also available through **[Glyptodon LLC](http://glyptodon.org/)**, the company founded around the Guacamole project. If interested, please <a href="mailto:contact@glyptodon.org" class="piwik_link" onclick="piwikTracker.trackGoal(8)">contact us for a quote</a>. Paid support helps drive development, and benefits both the project and the community.
